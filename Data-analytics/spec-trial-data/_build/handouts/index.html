<h1>Welcome to the Data Analytics Spec Trial Day</h1>
<section class="section" id="introduction-to-the-data-analytics-specialization">
<h2>Introduction to the Data Analytics Specialization</h2>
<section class="section" id="background">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Now more than ever, data is all around us. It comes in various forms and ranges from formal
research studies to consumer profile data and everything in between. Organizations in both
private and public sectors use data to answer questions and solve problems. Your job as a
Data Analyst would be gathering, preparing, and analyzing data, then communicating your
findings with your organization to make better, more informed decisions.</p>
<p>Further down the road, a career in data can lead to data engineering roles, which entail the
back end work of extracting, transforming, and loading large amounts of data into digestable
information ready to be analyzed, or data science roles which take data analysis to the next
level of machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="introduction-to-specializations">
<h3>Introduction to Specializations</h3>
<p>During Specializations, you will take a huge step towards your career in tech by not only
attaining skills in a particular technology area or stack, but also by getting accustomed to a
new work style that resembles the way you will work and learn in your first job. Your coding
bootcamp experience is technically over, and now you will begin your journey within the
technology industry.</p>
<p>Throughout your career as a Data Analyst/Engineer, you will need to continue
to learn and gain new skills. Developers will do this by carefully researching new
technologies, following online video tutorials, and practicing learned concepts. We designed
the Specializations program to mimic that learning experience. To do this, we’ve leveraged
a combination of video learning and carefully curated exercises. We also provide support
through multiple avenues including: daily stand-ups with your Tech Lead, weekly review
sessions, weekly one-on-one meetings with your Subject Matter Expert (SME), and queue support
during your class hours.</p>
<p>While this new learning environment will help prepare you for your first role and continued
learning, it will also present unique challenges for you to conquer. Some of these challenges
include: time management, self-awareness, and video fatigue. Overcoming these challenges at
Devmountain, while you have support, will help build the foundation for your growth as an
engineer.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="what-you-will-learn">
<h3>What You Will Learn</h3>
<p>This course prepares students with the knowledge and skills to start a career as a Data Analyst,
providing all requisite knowledge of data investigation, modeling, visualization, interpretation.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Git &amp; Github</p></li>
<li><p>Linux</p></li>
<li><p>Python</p></li>
<li><p>SQL</p></li>
<li><p>Jupyter Notebooks</p></li>
<li><p>Pandas</p></li>
<li><p>Splunk</p></li>
<li><p>Data cleansing</p></li>
<li><p>Data interpretation</p></li>
<li><p>Data modeling</p></li>
<li><p>Data visualization</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section" id="staff-during-specializations">
<h3>Staff During Specializations</h3>
<p><strong>Tech leads</strong> provide guidance, industry knowledge, and leadership during Specializations.
They are the primary leader throughout the day for students and ensure that students
are progressing with the support that they need. Tech Leads manage 1-2 technical programs
and communicate directly with Subject Matter Experts to escalate student questions. They
run daily Scrum Meetings, check in with students frequently, and monitor student progress.
They also help to maintain and update curriculum for their area(s).</p>
<p><em>Fun Fact: The role of the tech lead is modeled after the Team Lead in the tech industry. A
Team Lead is traditionally someone who is both an individual contributor but also coordinating
with team members and tracking and driving overall progress. While Team Leads are proactive in their
communication, it’s also important for the rest of the team to be proactive in keeping the Team
Lead up to date on blockers, progress, and other general information.</em>
<em>Tech leads do this and that…</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject Matter Experts</strong> answer student questions and provide feedback to students on
their comprehension of the material during weekly meetings. You can expect at minimum
one hour of one-on-one time with a SME each week during specialization, in addition to
any escalated questions you have the SMEs might answer either individually or with the
group based on collaboration with the Tech Lead.</p>
<p><em>Fun Fact: The SME role is modeled after Senior Engineers and SMEs (same name) within the tech industry.
In a real engineering org, SMEs and Senior Engineers are called upon to enable mid or junior level
folks when they run into blockers. As part of Specializations, you have the oppportunity to
work with real Subject Matter Experts with years of experience in the tech industry.
Not only will you learn things from them, you will also learn how to advocate for yourself
effectively. Working with SMEs on a less frequent basis than staff during Foundations will
enable you to build independence and confidence that will be invaluable when you
begin your first role within the tech industry.</em></p>

<div class="admonition-body docutils container">
<p>If you already completed the Python trial, feel free to skip this section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In foundations, you’ve been working with JavaScript, which is an object oriented
programming language. Python is another common object oriented programming language
which is used (in part) for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science.</p>
<p>While the Data Analytics program does not focus as heavily on Python software egineering,
it does use Python throughout the program to manipulate and analyze data.</p>
<p>For an introduction to Python, go to this video using your new Pluralsight login:</p>

<div class="admonition-body docutils container">
<p>Do not install Python prior to completing this interactive video lecture. There will be a IDE
(similar to Replt) for you to complete the interactive sections. You will install Python as part
of the Anaconda package with further instructions later on.</p>

<section class="section" id="read-js-and-python">
<h3>Read: JS and Python</h3>
<p>In addition, you can check out <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/geekculture/javascript-vs-python-syntax-cheatsheet-9bc7c59599c6" target="_blank">this article</a>
on the differences between JavaScript and Python syntax. You won’t need to understand or remember
all of this for today, so feel free to skim. We just want you to get a small feel for the
differences in the languages before you begin.</p>
<p>Again, this is a brief overview. However, you should be able to follow along better than most
because of your strong foundation in JavaScript!</p>

<section class="section" id="watch-jupyter-notebook">
<h3>Watch: Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p>In the Data Analytics specialization, the first week dives deeper into Python before you move into data analysis with Python.</p>
<p>Up to now, you’ve been working in VSCode for your projects. Today we will be using an application called Jupyter Notebook, which is standard in the field of data science.</p>
<p>To learn the basics of Jupyter notebook, you’ll watch <strong>Part 3</strong> of this video on Pluralsight -</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=d3b34e4c-ba79-4962-a340-7f4d41fe0ad8" target="_blank">Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook and Python by Douglas Starnes</a></p>
<p>When you open the video, use the navigation bar on the right of the screen to watch <strong>Part 3</strong> called “Moving from the REPL to a Notebook” (24 min 20 sec)</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Do not code along</p>
<div class="admonition-body docutils container">
<p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to code along during this video. Further instructions will be provided to

<section class="section" id="read-data-analysis-crash-course">
<h3>Read: Data Analysis Crash Course</h3>
<p>To begin, we’ll go over the data analysis lifecycle, which outlines the steps we must take in
every data analysis project.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis Lifecycle</strong></p>
<p>Every data analysis project goes through a process known as the Data Analysis Lifecycle.</p>
<p>This process is cyclical and one project may iterate through the different steps several times
before reaching completion. The lifecycle consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Define the question or identify the business issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Set Initial Requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare Data</p></li>
<li><p>Explore and Analyze Data</p></li>
<li><p>Validate Findings</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate Results</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following graphic is from Northeastern University which does a good job of visualizing the process:</p>

<p>Lastly, read
<a class="reference external" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/guides/online-resources-for-python-data-analytics" target="_blank">this article</a>
on Pluralsight to for a great explanation of how we’ll accomplish the steps
outlined above. (10 min read)</p>
